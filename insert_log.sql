  'Faction Lore and Achievements Gallery',
  'Implemented a comprehensive faction history and achievements system featuring three main sections: Timeline (animated vertical timeline with color-coded event nodes), Achievements (badge grid with hover effects and particle animations), and Lore Repository (searchable markdown-supported entries with category filtering). Created new TypeScript interfaces (FactionEvent, FactionAchievement, FactionLore) in Faction.ts. Added API hooks (useFactionEvents, useFactionAchievements, useFactionLore) with full CRUD operations in useFactions.ts. Built four new components: FactionLoreGallery (main orchestrator with Story Mode feature), TimelineView (expandable event cards with particle effects), AchievementBadges (animated badge grid revealing member names), and LoreRepository (searchable with category filters). Integrated into FactionDetails.tsx as new History & Achievements tab. Added comprehensive mock data including detailed lore entries with markdown content. Implemented advanced animations using Framer Motion including staggered entry, particle bursts, shine effects, and typewriter reveals. Created barrel export files for cleaner imports (api/factions.ts, api/characters.ts). All components follow existing theme with glassmorphism design, gradient accents, and dark mode support.',
