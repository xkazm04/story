# Strategic Project Brief – **StoryCraft**  
*(Vision, Value, Architecture – High‑Level Overview for Stakeholders)*  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

**StoryCraft** is a purpose‑built digital environment that transforms how writers conceive, build, and iterate on complex narratives. By marrying a modern, data‑driven front‑end (React Next.js 15) with a robust, Python‑based FastAPI backend, the product delivers a single, coherent workspace where characters, factions, traits, scenes, beats, and relationships coexist in a flexible, project‑centric data model.  

The system empowers creative teams to:

* **Structure stories** into acts and scenes with drag‑and‑drop sequencing.  
* **Define characters and factions** with rich trait and relationship graphs.  
* **Iterate on beats** and scenes through a lightweight, spreadsheet‑like UI.  
* **Visualise relationships** graphically to spot narrative contradictions or opportunities.  

These capabilities accelerate the creative cycle, reduce re‑work, and provide a data‑first foundation that can be extended for analytics, AI‑assisted drafting, and collaboration.

## 2. Vision & Value Proposition  

| Pillar | Vision | Stakeholder Benefit | Success Metric |
|--------|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Creative Freedom** | A single canvas where every narrative component is connected, searchable, and editable. | Writers spend less time re‑engineering story structure, more time on story‑making. | 30 % reduction in average scene‑creation time. |
| **Data‑First Narrative** | Every element (character, beat, scene) is an entity in a relational model, enabling rich analytics and AI‑driven suggestions. | Editors and publishers can surface high‑quality stories faster. | 25 % increase in completed story drafts per month. |
| **Scalable Collaboration** | The platform is API‑first; it can be consumed by web, mobile, or desktop clients. | Teams can adopt the tool in hybrid or remote workflows. | 3 new client integrations (mobile, desktop) by Q4 2025. |
| **Enterprise‑Ready** | Secure, rate‑limited, and versioned API layer with future‑proof error handling. | Customers can integrate StoryCraft into existing content pipelines. | 95 % API uptime; < 100 ms average latency for core reads. |

## 3. Architectural Landscape  

### 3.1 Layered Design  

1. **Core Infrastructure** – Type‑safe `api.ts`, `ApiError.ts`, `rateLimiter.ts`, and `useApiErrorHandler` provide a unified HTTP layer.  
2. **API Gateway** – Next.js 15 App Router routes act as a **proxy** to the external FastAPI service, handling rate limiting, authentication, and request shaping.  
3. **Feature Modules** – Dedicated APIs (characters, factions, acts, scenes, beats, relationships, traits) expose CRUD operations, all wired to React Query for caching and optimistic updates.  
4. **Domain Models** – Rich TypeScript interfaces (`Act`, `Scene`, `Beat`, `Character`, `Faction`, etc.) capture business logic.  
5. **UI & UX** – React components and hooks (`ActManager`, `ScenesList`, `CharacterList`, `RelationshipGraph`) provide a low‑friction, responsive experience.  

### 3.2 Data Flow  

```
UI   →  React Query Hook  →  useApiGet / useApiMutation  →  
        rateLimiter.queue  →  apiFetch (JSON / Abort)  →  
        Next.js API Route  →  Proxy → Python/FastAPI  →  
        Database (PostgreSQL)  →  JSON Response  →  
        Next.js Route  →  React Query Cache  →  UI Render
```

*Every API call is queued, retried once on transient failure, and automatically cancelled if stale.*

### 3.3 Key Technical Choices  

| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| **React Query** | Built‑in caching, deduplication, and refetch strategies reduce network load. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Queue‑based sliding window prevents burst traffic; adjustable thresholds support scaling. |
| **Next.js 15 App Router** | Unified routing, server‑side rendering, and edge‑compute capabilities. |
| **Python/FastAPI Backend** | High‑performance, async service; decoupled from the front‑end for agility. |
| **Type‑Safe API** | Compile‑time guarantees lower runtime bugs and improves developer velocity. |

## 4. Strategic Recommendations  

| Objective | Recommended Action | Owner | Timeline |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|----------|
| **Accelerate Time‑to‑Value** | Implement a **one‑click template wizard** for 3‑act / 5‑act structures and pre‑populated scenes. | Product & Engineering | Q1 2025 |
| **Enhance Collaboration** | Add **real‑time presence** and **commenting** to scenes and beats via WebSockets (Socket.IO). | Platform & DevOps | Q2 2025 |
| **Increase Adoption** | Launch an **API Explorer** with auto‑generated docs (OpenAPI / Swagger) to allow third‑party developers to integrate. | API & Documentation | Q3 2025 |
| **Ensure Reliability** | Integrate **Sentry** for runtime error tracking and **Health‑check endpoints** for uptime dashboards. | Ops & Security | Q1 2025 |
| **Future‑Proof UI** | Adopt **Story‑Graph** (graph‑based narrative visualisation) as a flagship feature for large stories. | UX & Design | Q4 2025 |
| **Data Governance** | Enforce **field‑level encryption** for sensitive traits/traits and provide audit logs for changes. | Security & Compliance | Q3 2025 |
| **Expand Platform Reach** | Build a **mobile SDK** (React‑Native) that consumes the same API layer, targeting tablet writers. | Mobile Team | Q2 2026 |
