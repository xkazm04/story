Generated: "Marcus grew up in the industrial district of Nova City, the son of
           a factory worker who died in a workplace accident when Marcus was twelve.
           The corporation's refusal to take responsibility planted the seeds of his
           cynicism toward authority. His younger sister's illness drove him to take
           dangerous courier jobs to pay for treatment, forming his fierce loyalty to
           those he cares about. The accident that killed his partner five years ago
           continues to haunt him, manifesting in nightmares and an obsessive need to
           double-check every detail before a job..."
```

#### 3. Character Dialogue Styler ✅

**Use Case**:
```
Character: "Dr. Ashford", Traits: ["Intellectual", "Pompous", "Insecure"]
Dialogue Style:
- Frequent use of academic jargon and Latin phrases
- Tendency to over-explain simple concepts
- Often corrects others' grammar or word choice
- Speaks in long, complex sentences
- Defensive when questioned, deflecting with humor

---

## Phase 7: Final Integration & Polish ✅

### Cross-Feature Integration

#### Scene-to-Video Workflow
1. **Scene Created** → User writes scene with dialogue
2. **Scene Enhanced** → Use SceneDescriptionEnhancer and DialogueImprover
3. **Storyboard Generated** → Use SceneToStoryboard to break into shots
4. **Videos Generated** → Generate video for each storyboard frame
5. **Review & Edit** → View all videos in sequence, edit as needed

#### Character-to-Scene Workflow
1. **Character Created** → Use AI tools to develop traits, backstory, dialogue style
2. **Scene Written** → Scene references character
3. **Dialogue Enhanced** → DialogueImprover uses character traits for voice consistency
4. **Voice Generated** → Use Voice feature with character's voice profile
5. **Video Generated** → Visual representation matches character appearance

#### Image-to-Video Workflow
1. **Image Generated** → Create character or scene image
2. **Motion Added** → Use motionDescriptionPrompt to add movement
3. **Video Generated** → Animate the image with suggested motion
4. **Storyboard Integration** → Add to storyboard frame

### Architecture Consistency

All phases follow the same patterns established in Phases 1-3:

**LLM Integration Pattern**:
```typescript
const { generateFromTemplate, isLoading } = useLLM();

const enhance = async () => {
  const result = await generateFromTemplate(promptTemplate, context);
  if (result) {
    handleResult(result.content);
  }
};
```

**Supabase Pattern**:
```typescript
const { data, isLoading } = useResourceByProject(projectId);
const createResource = useCreateResource();
const updateResource = useUpdateResource();
const deleteResource = useDeleteResource();
```

**Component Pattern**:
- Feature containers with tabs
- Reusable enhancement components
- Consistent styling with theme colors
- Motion animations with Framer Motion
- Loading states and error handling
