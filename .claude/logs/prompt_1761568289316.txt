REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# create-faction-branding-customization-panel

## Description

Build a faction branding customization panel that enables faction leaders to define and customize their faction's visual identity including color schemes, emblem styles, and banner templates. This feature creates a new dedicated component for branding management, integrates with the existing faction system, and provides preset templates alongside custom color pickers. Store branding preferences in the faction record and apply them across faction cards, member profiles, and related UI elements.

## Implementation Steps

1. Extend Faction interface in src/app/types/Faction.ts to include branding properties: add `branding?: FactionBranding` interface with fields: primary_color, secondary_color, accent_color, emblem_style (shield|crest|sigil|custom), banner_template (standard|ornate|minimal|custom), custom_logo_url, theme_tier (free|premium)
2. Create src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/FactionBrandingPanel.tsx component with tabbed interface: Color Customizer (color pickers for primary/secondary/accent), Emblem Designer (preset styles with preview), Banner Templates (template gallery with live preview), and Theme Tier indicator
3. Create src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/ColorCustomizer.tsx sub-component with color picker input, preset color palette from CreateFactionForm.tsx PRESET_COLORS, live preview of faction card with selected colors, and save/reset functionality
4. Create src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/EmblemDesigner.tsx sub-component that displays emblem style presets (shield, crest, sigil) with visual previews, allows selection and preview updates, includes option to upload custom emblem image with size validation
5. Add branding API hooks to src/app/api/factions.ts: `updateFactionBranding(factionId, branding)` to persist branding changes with proper error handling and cache invalidation, `getFactionBrandingPresets()` to return available templates and presets
6. Integrate FactionBrandingPanel into FactionDetails.tsx as a new 'Branding' tab accessible only to faction leaders, positioned after Media Gallery tab with smooth transitions
7. Update FactionCard.tsx to apply faction branding colors and emblem styling from the branding object, with fallback to default styling if branding not set

## Files to Modify

- src/app/types/Faction.ts
- src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/FactionBrandingPanel.tsx
- src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/ColorCustomizer.tsx
- src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/EmblemDesigner.tsx
- src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/FactionDetails.tsx
- src/app/features/characters/sub_CharFactions/FactionCard.tsx
- src/app/api/factions.ts

## UI/UX Innovation Experiment

Create an interactive emblem preview that updates in real-time as users select colors and styles, using SVG-based emblem rendering with animated transitions between styles. Add a 'theme gallery' showing how the selected branding looks across different contexts (card, profile header, banner). Include a 'preview mode' toggle that shows a full faction page preview with applied branding in a split-screen view.

## Update FILE_STRUCTURE.MD

IMPORTANT: After implementing the changes, update the FILE_STRUCTURE.MD file in the context directory to reflect the latest changes.

Include:
1. New files created or modified
2. Updated component relationships
3. New patterns or architectural decisions

At the end of FILE_STRUCTURE.MD, add a "## Next Steps" section with your recommendation for the next goal or feature to implement based on the current progress.

## Recommended Next Goal

Implement faction theme monetization by creating a premium tier system where users can unlock exclusive emblem styles, animated emblems, and advanced color gradients. Add a 'theme marketplace' component showcasing available premium themes with purchase functionality integrated into the branding panel.



IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Analyze the requirement thoroughly
- Identify all files that need to be modified or created
- Implement all changes specified in the requirement
- Follow the implementation steps precisely
- Create/modify files as needed
- Run any tests if specified
- Ensure all changes are complete before finishing

## Context Reference Updates

After implementing changes, if the requirement references a specific CONTEXT (feature group), update the context documentation:

1. Look for `.context` files in the project that match the feature being implemented
2. Update the context file with:
   - New files created
   - Modified components
   - Updated functionality
   - New patterns introduced

Example: If working on "authentication" feature, update `contexts/authentication/.context` with the changes.

## File Structure Guidelines (Next.js/React Projects)

When creating new files in Next.js/React projects, follow this structure:

**Feature-Specific Files** (use `app/features/<feature>` structure):
- `app/features/<feature>/components/` - Feature-specific components and UI sections
- `app/features/<feature>/lib/` - Feature-specific functions, utilities, and logical helpers
- `app/features/<feature>/` - Main wrapper, index, or page file for the feature

**Reusable UI Components** (use `app/components/ui` structure):
- `app/components/ui/` - Shared, reusable UI elements used across multiple features

**Theming and Styling**:
- Before creating new UI components, examine existing components in the project
- Match the color scheme, spacing, and visual patterns of existing components
- Use consistent className patterns (Tailwind CSS classes)
- Follow the app's design language (glassmorphism, gradients, shadows, etc.)
- Pay attention to dark mode support if the app uses it

Examples:
- Feature component: `app/features/tasks/components/TaskCard.tsx`
- Feature helper: `app/features/tasks/lib/taskValidation.ts`
- Reusable UI: `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`

## Implementation Logging

**CRITICAL**: After completing the implementation, create a log entry in the SQLite database to track what was implemented.

Database Path: `C:\Users\kazda\kiro\story\database\goals.db`
Table: `implementation_log`
Project ID: `dd11e61e-f267-4e52-95c5-421b1ed9567b`

Execute this SQL command after implementation (replace placeholders with actual values):

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '<generate-unique-uuid>',
  'dd11e61e-f267-4e52-95c5-421b1ed9567b',
  '<requirement-name>',
  '<short-descriptive-title>',
  '<detailed-overview-of-changes>',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**Log Entry Guidelines**:
- `id`: Generate a unique UUID (e.g., using `crypto.randomUUID()` or similar)
- `project_id`: The project identifier (use: "dd11e61e-f267-4e52-95c5-421b1ed9567b")
- `requirement_name`: Name of the requirement file being executed
- `title`: Short, descriptive title (2-6 words, e.g., "Add User Authentication")
- `overview`: Detailed paragraph describing:
  - What was implemented
  - Key files created or modified
  - Major functionality added
  - Any important patterns or decisions made
- `tested`: Always set to 0 (false) initially
- `created_at`: Use `datetime('now')` for current timestamp

**Example Log Entry**:

```sql
INSERT INTO implementation_log (
  id,
  project_id,
  requirement_name,
  title,
  overview,
  tested,
  created_at
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  'project-abc-123',
  'implement-user-login',
  'User Login System',
  'Implemented complete user authentication system with login form, JWT token management, and session persistence. Created LoginForm.tsx component, authService.ts for API calls, and useAuth hook for state management. Added protected route wrapper and login/logout functionality. Integrated with existing theme using glassmorphism design.',
  0,
  datetime('now')
);
```

**How to Execute the SQL**:
Use the sqlite3 command-line tool or Node.js better-sqlite3 library:

```bash
sqlite3 "C:\Users\kazda\kiro\story\database\goals.db" "INSERT INTO implementation_log (...) VALUES (...);"
```

Or in Node.js/TypeScript:
```typescript
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
const db = new Database('C:\Users\kazda\kiro\story\database\goals.db');
db.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO implementation_log (id, project_id, requirement_name, title, overview, tested, created_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, datetime('now'))
`).run(id, projectId, requirementName, title, overview, 0);
db.close();
```
