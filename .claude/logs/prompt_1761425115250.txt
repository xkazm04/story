REQUIREMENT TO EXECUTE NOW:

# Add AbortController to apiFetch for request cancellation

## Metadata
- **Category**: code_quality
- **Effort**: Unknown (N/A/3)

## Description
Extend the apiFetch helper to accept an AbortSignal and automatically cancel in-flight requests when the component unmounts or a new request supersedes the previous one. This prevents race conditions and reduces memory usage for long-running fetches.

## Reasoning
Without cancellation, aborted requests can still resolve and attempt to update state, leading to "state update on unmounted component" warnings and stale data. Introducing AbortController ensures that only the latest response is processed, improving performance and reliability.

## Implementation Guidelines

Please implement this feature following these guidelines:

1. **Code Quality**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
2. **Testing**: Add appropriate tests if applicable
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and edge cases
5. **User Experience**: Consider the user experience and accessibility

## Acceptance Criteria

The implementation should:
- Fulfill the description and reasoning outlined above
- Maintain or improve code quality
- Be well-tested and documented
- Follow project conventions and patterns
